# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### A Microservices based ASP.NET Core codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [RealWorld Repo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged backend application built with **ASP.NET Core** and **[Optional](https://github.com/nlkl/Optional)**. It includes CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

It completely adheres to the **ASP.NET Core** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
